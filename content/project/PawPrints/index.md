 I participated in a blockchain competition where me and my team developed a blockchain powered platform for pet medical record tracking and sharing, ultimately securing first place and winning $15000 in Franklin Templeton’s 2023 Blockchain Contest. 
 
 Without a unified system between owners, hospitals, and insurance providers, the reimbursement process for pets has been a tedious process with a lack of trust between the three parties. This project aims to fix the paperwork process of pet medical care and insurance using blockchain technology. We came up with a custom Solidity contract that provides cross-verification for pet owners, hospitals, and insurance companies. 
 
 The project runs on Polygon, a side-chain from Ethereum, which has all the characteristics of ETH with much cheaper costs. We utilized Node.js for backend development, MySQL for database management, and a React-based frontend, connected via REST API.
